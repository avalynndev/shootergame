# ShooterGame

A top-down shooter I made with Godot Engine 4.1.

## 🎮 What is this?

Basically, it's a top-down shooter game where you move around with WASD, aim with your mouse, and shoot stuff. You'll face enemies across different levels and try to survive as long as you can. Pretty straightforward!

## ✨ Features

- **Shoot stuff** - Move with WASD, aim with your mouse, click to shoot. Simple and fun!
- **Multiple levels** - Beat enemies to move on to the next level. Gets tougher as you go.
- **Enemy combat** - Different types of enemies that actually fight back (they don't just stand there!)
- **Health system** - You've got 5 hearts. Try not to lose them all!
- **Smooth controls** - Controls feel responsive and tight (at least I think so!)
- **Progress through levels** - Clear each level to advance to the next one

## 🎯 How to Play

- **W/A/S/D** - Move around (Up/Left/Down/Right)
- **Mouse** - Aim where you want to shoot
- **Left Click** - Shoot bullets

That's it! Pretty simple, right?
